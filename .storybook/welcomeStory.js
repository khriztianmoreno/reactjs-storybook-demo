    <p>I keep hearing various definitions, so let me start by saying what a Design System isnâ€™t:
      it is not a Sketch library, no more than a Style guide or a Pattern Libraryâ€¦ Actually,
      itâ€™s all of this and so much more!
    </p>
    <blockquote>A Design System is the single source of truth which groups all the elements that will allow the teams to design, realize and develop a product.</blockquote>
